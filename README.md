Group 5: Alina, Layla, and Nicholas Dinh
Chosen product: Instant Ramen
There are three notebooks that show each of our additional ideas. We then chose two to develop further.
From there, there are two notebooks that represent our Product A prompting and Product B prompting.
From there, there are two notebooks with our webpages, titled "Nomad_Webpage" and "Nourish_Webpage" for Product A and Product B, respectively. The file called "Webpage_Prompting" has all combined LLM prompts for creating the webpages. 
From there, there is one notebook of our AnB Testing.
