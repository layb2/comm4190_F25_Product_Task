    "Concept: Customizable, health-conscious instant noodles with a modern twist\n",
    "\n",
    "*Key Features*:\n",
    "\n",
    "Base noodles made from alternative flours (quinoa, chickpea, or sweet potato) for higher protein and nutrient content\n",
    "\n",
    "\"Flavor Fusion\" system: Multiple seasoning packets in one package that can be mixed and matched to create unique combinations (e.g., combine Korean BBQ with Thai Lime, or Truffle Mushroom with Japanese Miso)\n",
    "\n",
    "Fresh freeze-dried vegetable and protein packets included (not just dehydrated)\n",

    "Foodies who want convenience without sacrificing flavor\n",
    "Environmentally conscious consumers\n",
    "This concept combines the convenience of instant noodles with customization options, better nutrition, and environmental responsibility - addressing many pain points in the current instant noodle market.\n",

    "**Prompt**: I want a cooler name that isn't cringey\n",
    "\n",
    "**Response**: \n",
    "\n",
    "Here are some stronger name options:\n",
    "```\n",
    "\"Nudo\" (simple, modern, plays on 'noodle')\n",
    "\"Slurp & Co.\" (playful but still professional)\n",
    "\"Bowllab\" (combines 'bowl' and 'lab' - suggesting innovation)\n",
    "\"Nomad Noodles\" (appeals to modern, adventurous eaters)\n",
    "\"Craft Ramen\" (simple, suggests quality)\n",
    "\"Miso & Co\" (sophisticated, memorable)\n",
    "\"Nori\" (short, clean, Japanese-inspired)\n",
    "\"Bowl & Soul\" (warm, authentic feeling)\n",
    "\"Koru\" (Maori word for spiral, unique but easy to say)\n",
    "\"Otoko\" (Japanese for 'essence', sounds sharp)\n",
    "From these, I think \"Nudo\" or \"Bowllab\" work particularly well - they're modern, easy to remember, work well for branding, and aren't trying too hard to be cool. They also leave room for the brand to grow beyond just ramen/noodles if desired.\n",
